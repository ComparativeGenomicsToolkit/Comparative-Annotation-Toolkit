    Main function for assigning parental genes. Parental gene assignment methodology:
    A) Each denovo transcript is evaluated for overlapping any transMap transcripts.
    Overlap is defined as having at least 1 exonic base shared.
    B) If a denovo transcript is assigned to more than one gene, then this is attempted to be resolved.
    Resolution occurs by looking first at the transMap themselves. If any transMap projections overlap each other
    with a Jaccard metric > 0.001, then we call this as a badAnnotOrTm. These will be discarded unless all splices
    are supported.
    Next, we look at the asymmetric distance between this prediction and the gene intervals. If this difference
    in these distances is over min_distance for all comparisons, we call this rescued and it can be incorporated.
    Otherwise, this transcript is tagged ambiguousOrFusion.
